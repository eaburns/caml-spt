The purpose of SPT is to allow researchers to view raw data in a graphical format. SPT can produce high-quality graphical displays of data as .pdf, .ps and .png images. The goal is to encourage better data analysis by providing a tool that enables data to be easily viewed in a variety of different formats. SPT makes it easy to create standard lines plots, scatter plots and bar charts. Using SPT, it is also simple to create box plots, mean-value lines with 95% confidence intervals, and histograms to display distributions of data. Additionally, SPT has support for displaying trees (a standard data structure for many computer science applications).

Some features of SPT are:
Many different types of plots, including:
Scatter plots
Scatter plots with labels and error bars
Lines plots
Lines plots with error bars showing 95% confidence
Histograms
Bubble plots
Cumulative density functions
Heat maps
Box plots with 95% confidence intervals
Barcharts
Stacked Barcharts
Fanned Barcharts
Grouped nominal plots (bar charts and boxplots)
Sunburst trees diagrams (library version only)
Arbitrary single variable functions (library version only)
A simple graphical user interface for viewing plots
Intelligent tick-mark placement
Data is never obstructed by an axis (uses proper padding)
Performs some simple data analysis (confidence intervals, box statistics, histogram binning, etc.)
An Objective Caml library interface
A simple lisp-inspired plotting language
Generates: .ps, .pdf or .png images

SPT is available either as a library for the Objective Caml language or as a binary which reads a simple (lisp-inspired) plotting language. Future releases are expected to have bindings allowing library access via C or C++ programs.
