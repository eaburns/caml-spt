* Drawing legends off of the plot.

* Change text size based on plot size

* Scatter plot matrix

* Increase/decrease the number of error bars with the size of the plot?

* Legend.At uses floats instead of Length.t's.

------------------------------------------------------------
Datasets
------------------------------------------------------------

* Label bestfit lines with the polynomial.

* Datasets should somehow 'know' the size of the plot that they are
  currently being drawn to.

* Line and error bar plots should plot no more than 200 points.

* Make the line_errbar style just be an error bar style.  Maybe errbar
  datasets should compute the confidence interval (using interpolation)
  themselves?

* kernel density estimation datasets
   - make the dataset object
   - automatic bandwidth selection

* "boxplots with density estimations"

* Boxplots: 'jitter' outliers that overlap
  (local search to minimize overlap among all outliers?)

* Normal quantile plots

* CDF's need error bars

* Heatmaps - Nominal by Nominal

* Montages: more complex than simple ps-montage style.
  - Make axis drawing optional.
  - Make room for non-drawn axes, but then don't draw them.

------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation
------------------------------------------------------------

* Write a real README file

* Document all functions
  - Generate OCaml docs

* How to use within AI group

------------------------------------------------------------
Usability
------------------------------------------------------------

* GUI dialog for changing plot sizes could be better
  (drop-down menu for units, tab cycles fields, fields of the
  appropriate size).

* Bindings
  - C/C++
  - Python
  - Java?

------------------------------------------------------------
spt-it-out
------------------------------------------------------------

* label datasets

* scatter with errbar datasets

* Barchat datasets of various kinds

* Tree plots

* The two kinds of heatmap datasets

* Including other spt-it-out files

* More simple numeric operations (plus, times, etc.)

------------------------------------------------------------
Plot types
------------------------------------------------------------

* Nominal by nominal plots

* Numeric by Ordinal (or Ranked) plots
  Like numeric by nominal except that x-axis is a set of ranked values
  and the datasets are drawn across both the x and y axes.
  - Waterfall charts
  - Run charts
