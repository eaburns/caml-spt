Things that we need before anyone can begin beta testing
------------------------------------------------------------

* Decide on a final API
  two basic types of functions, on for generating single datalests,
  one for making list of related datasets that dispatches to the first
  type.  One of these calls for each dataset type.  Each inside of its
  own file.
  -- Num by num datasets are done

* Order legends by mean y-value in num_by_num plots.

------------------------------------------------------------
Extra features
------------------------------------------------------------

* Drawing legends off of the plot.

* Change text size based on plot size

* Scatter plot matrix

------------------------------------------------------------
Datasets
------------------------------------------------------------

* Normal quantile plots

* Histograms:
   - Hash marks filling the histograms
   - Coloring w/ alpha values

* CDF's need error bars

* Make sure we present a consistent type to the world for all datasets

* Heatmaps
  - Numeric by Numeric
  - Nominal by Nominal

* Stacked bar charts
  - need to do some kind of different colorization of the stacked bars
   -> My thought is to make each stacked dataset take a list of
   barchart datasets.  It will then proceed to draw each bar from the
   tallest to the shortest overlapping eachother.  This way the
   drawing of bars is separated from the stacked chart and each bar
   will be its own color (if the user gave them each different
   colors).  Then, overwrite the draw_x_label (and x_label_height)
   method for stacked so that it can draw the names each on their own
   line from tallest to smallest followed by the name of the stack.


* Make sure that everything is colorable

* Montages: more complex than simple ps-montage style.
  - Make axis drawing optional.
  - Make room for non-drawn axes, but then don't draw them.

------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation
------------------------------------------------------------

* Write a real README file

* Document the code

* Generate OCaml docs

------------------------------------------------------------
Usability
------------------------------------------------------------

* Add an edit menu to the gtk gui allowing for
      * Specify the size of the plot -- make sure to pre-populate dialogue
      * Turn color on / off

* Grouping num by nom datasets in spt-it-out

* Minimum Plot size requirement in Gtk window needs removed

* Generate .mli files where possible / appropriate

* Bindings
  - C
  - Python
  - Java?

------------------------------------------------------------
spt-it-out
------------------------------------------------------------

* label datasets

* scatter with errbar datasets

* Simple arithmetic... mapping log10 over things, etc.

* Including other spt-it-out files

------------------------------------------------------------
Plot types
------------------------------------------------------------

* Nominal by nominal plots

* Numeric by Ordinal (or Ranked) plots
  Like numeric by nominal except that x-axis is a set of ranked values
  and the datasets are drawn across both the x and y axes.
  - Waterfall charts
  - Run charts
