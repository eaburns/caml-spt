* Multiple output formats.

* Line and error bar plots
  (Including the style factory)

* Legends
  - Drawing legends off of the plot.
  - Make a 'legend plot'?

* Legacy module (in ps_plot)

* Compute better 'tick' locations on numeric axes

----------------------------------------

* Lines points plots

* Montages: more complex than simple ps-montage style.
  - Make axis drawing optional.
  - Make room for non-drawn axes, but then don't draw them.

* Fix label datasets to offset the label in the plot coordinate system
  So when labeling scatter plots the label doesn't overwrite the
  glyph.

* A color factory

* Make sure that everything is colored

* Box plots

* Bar charts?
  With error bars?

* Developer readme: each plot draws itself into a unit square.





* An interface in the GTK interface
  - keyboard support (q quits)
  - Button to save to a file.

* Read plots from files
  Involves parsing

* C bindings

* Numeric by Ordinal (or Ranked) plots
  This includes run charts, etc. where you have a labeled x-axis where
  each value is something that I don't feel like describing here.

* Waterfall charts?
