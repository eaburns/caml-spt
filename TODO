------------------------------------------------------------
Things that we need before anyone can begin beta testing
------------------------------------------------------------

* Decide on a final API
  two basic types of functions, on for generating single datalests,
  one for making list of related datasets that dispatches to the first
  type.  One of these calls for each dataset type.  Each inside of its
  own file.
  -- Num by num datasets are done

* Legacy module (in ps_plot)

* Add a constants file of some sort, or a configurable datafile that
  is read in


* Fix residuals on label datasets (plot spt-debug with x_min=6.0)

------------------------------------------------------------
Extra features
------------------------------------------------------------
* Add an edit menu to the gtk gui allowing for
      * Specify the size of the plot -- make sure to pre-populate dialogue
      * Turn color on / off

* Drawing legends off of the plot.

* Change text size based on plot size

* Scatter plot matrix

------------------------------------------------------------
Datasets
------------------------------------------------------------
* Make sure we present a consistent type to the world for all datasets

* Heatmaps
  - Numeric by Numeric
  - Nominal by Nominal

* Bar charts (and with error bars)

* Stacked bar charts
  - Diffenent hash marks filling bars (for situations when there are no colors)

* Histograms

* Box set dataset

* Make sure that everything is colorable

* Montages: more complex than simple ps-montage style.
  - Make axis drawing optional.
  - Make room for non-drawn axes, but then don't draw them.

------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation
------------------------------------------------------------

* Write a real README file

* Document the code

* Generate OCaml docs

------------------------------------------------------------
Usability
------------------------------------------------------------

* Push factories from most datasets into src/factories.ml
  -- Line_errbars get to keep theres since they belong there
  --- Alternatively, why isn't the errbar stuff in the errbar dataset?

* Minimum Plot size requirement in Gtk window needs removed

* Generate .mli files where possible / appropriate

* Bindings
  - C
  - Python
  - Java?

------------------------------------------------------------
Plot types
------------------------------------------------------------

* Nominal by nominal plots

* Numeric by Ordinal (or Ranked) plots
  Like numeric by nominal except that x-axis is a set of ranked values
  and the datasets are drawn across both the x and y axes.
  - Waterfall charts
  - Run charts
