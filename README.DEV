1.0 Kinds of data

 There are a variety of different kinds of data.  We are concerned
 with a few kinds: 1) Numeric data consists of floating point numbers,
 2) Nominal data is names or strings with no numeric relation to each
 other like "OCaml", "C" and "Java", 3) Ordinal data is like nominal
 data but in this case order matters like in the months of the year.

 Typically a plot has two axes each showing for a single kind of data.
 Since the scales are different, each kind of data needs a different
 kind of axis.  Because of this, ml-plot uses a few (currently 2)
 different types of plots: 1) numeric by numeric plots have two
 numeric axes and 2) numeric by nominal plots have a nominal
 horizontal axis and a numeric vertical axis.  A numeric by numeric
 plot is used for plotting things like lines or points on a Cartesian
 coordinate system.  Numeric by nominal plots are used for plotting
 things like box plots where there are a variety of sets of scalar
 numeric (hence "numeric") data each with a distinct name (hence "by
 nominal").  Currently there is no specific support for ordinal data
 (although this could be *hacked* into a numeric by nominal plot).

2.0 Separation of libs

 I think that it is beneficial to keep the references to external
 libraries in a small number of easily findable places.  The Cairo
 library is currently used to do all of the 2D drawing.  Preferably
 all of the calls to Cairo will take place in the Drawing module or
 maybe one or two other places.  This way we can easily change the
 backend or even add new ones in the future.
